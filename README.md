1. Introduction to .NET Framework and C#

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer framework for building 
many different types of applications. It allows developers to use multiple 
languages (C#, F#, and Visual Basic), editors, and libraries to build 
applications that can run on a wide variety of platforms, including Windows, 
Linux, and macOS.

C# is a popular language developed by Microsoft and used in the .NET framework. 
It's a statically typed, object-oriented language that's known for its versatility 
and user-friendly syntax.

2. Setting Up the Development Environment

To get started with .NET and C#, you'll need to install the .NET SDK (Software 
Development Kit) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The most common 
IDE for .NET is Visual Studio. You can download the .NET SDK and Visual Studio 
from the official Microsoft website.
