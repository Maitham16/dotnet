Create a Console Application:
dotnet new console -o mycalculator

program.cs:
using System;

namespace simpleCalculator
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Simple Calculator in C#");

            Console.WriteLine("Enter a number: ");
            string num1 = Console.ReadLine();
            double number1 = Convert.ToDouble(num1);

            Console.WriteLine("Enter another number: ");
            string num2 = Console.ReadLine();
            double number2 = Convert.ToDouble(num2);

            double result = number1 + number2;

            Console.WriteLine($"The result is of adding {number1} and {number2}: " + result);
        }
    }
}

Run the Application:
cd mycalculator
dotnet run

This might seem straightforward if you've programmed before, but let's make sure we 
understand the basic structure:

    using System; - This line allows the program to use the System namespace, which 
                    includes fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used 
                    value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, 
                    attributes, and processing exceptions.

    namespace simpleCalculator - The namespace keyword is used to declare a scope that 
                                 contains a set of related objects. You can use a namespace 
                                 to organize code elements and to create globally unique 
                                 types.

    class Program - This line declares a class named Program. C# is an object-oriented 
                    programming language, and a class is a blueprint for creating objects 
                    (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state 
                    (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior 
                    (member functions or methods). The Program class in this example 
                    contains the code that will be executed when you run your application.

    static void Main(string[] args) - This is the Main method, the entry point for your 
                                      application. When you run your program, this is the 
                                      method that gets called first. It is always named Main 
                                      and is always static. In this case, it doesn't return 
                                      any value (void) and takes an array of strings as 
                                      parameters, which are the arguments passed from the 
                                      command line.
